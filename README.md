# unp-sql

During my internship with the United Network of Professionals (UNP), I successfully completed a project called "Maven_Market." Here are the key highlights:

1.Database Creation: I created the "Maven_Market" database, which included tables for Customers, Products, Regions, Returns, Stores, and Transactions. To ensure data integrity, I implemented defined constraints.

2.Backup and Transformation: I backed up the database as "Maven_Market_Backup" and performed date column transformations for consistency. The modified data was then migrated back into the original database.

3.Insightful Queries: I executed various queries to derive valuable insights, including:

Calculating costs, sales figures, and revenue. Analyzing customer demographics and product performance. Segmenting revenue and sales data by region, income, and membership. This project not only involved technical skills in database management but also required analytical thinking to extract meaningful information for decision-making.
